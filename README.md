A tool to isolate stems from audio tracks to create custom backing tracks - perfect for guitar practice or solo jams.

## Roadmap

- Basic stem separation functionality (DSP + PyTorch)
- CLI support for input/output audio files
- Add GUI interface for easier usage
- More complex separation: Rhythm and Lead Guitar, etc


## Acknowledgements

This section will include a list of all sources, research papers, libraries, and tools referenced during the design and development of the models and overall system.
